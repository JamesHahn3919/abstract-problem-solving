>Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:
What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

Before you start, you will need a jar or peanut butter, a jar of jelly, a plate to assemble the sandwich on, and a butter knife. Start by opening the jar of peanut butter, then use the butter knife to apply a thin, even coat of peanut butter to one side of one of the slices of bread. Then open the jar of jelly and use the knife to spread a thin, even layer of jelly on one side of the other slice of bread. Place one of the slices of bread on top of the other, with the side of the slice that has the ingredient on it facing downwards, so that the peanut butter and jelly are stacked in the middle of the two pieces of bread, with the clean side of each slice facing outward. Then, close the jars, wash the knife, and enjoy!

>In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.

Follow the steps backwards until you find the last step that works correctly.

>Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.

The problem I'll be using as my example is not being able to find my car keys, and in most cases, i've either left them on the kitchen table or on my side table. The roadmap for finding my keys is Check key hook -> Check kitchen table -> check side table -> start car
